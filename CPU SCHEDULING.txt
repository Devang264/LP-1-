### Definitions:

1. **Burst Time**: 
   - **Definition**: Burst time refers to the amount of time a process requires to execute on the CPU. It is also called **execution time** or **CPU burst time**.
   - **Example**: If a process requires 5 units of time to complete its task on the CPU, its burst time is 5.

2. **Arrival Time**:
   - **Definition**: Arrival time refers to the time at which a process arrives in the ready queue and is ready to be executed.
   - **Example**: If a process arrives at time unit 2, its arrival time is 2.

3. **Completion Time (CT)**:
   - **Definition**: Completion time refers to the time at which a process finishes its execution. It is calculated based on the order in which processes are executed.
   - **Formula**: For a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm (e.g., FCFS), the completion time of a process is the sum of its arrival time and burst time, considering the previous process’s completion time.
   - **Formula for Completion Time (CT)**:
     \[
     \text{Completion Time} (CT) = \text{Start Time} + \text{Burst Time}
     \]
     where Start Time is the time when the process starts executing.

4. **Turnaround Time (TAT)**:
   - **Definition**: Turnaround time refers to the total time taken by a process from its arrival to completion.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{Turnaround Time} (TAT) = \text{Completion Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
     \]
     or
     \[
     \text{Turnaround Time} (TAT) = \text{Waiting Time} + \text{Burst Time}
     \]
     Turnaround time gives you the entire time a process spends from the moment it arrives in the queue to the moment it finishes execution.

5. **Waiting Time (WT)**:
   - **Definition**: Waiting time is the amount of time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it gets CPU time to execute. It excludes the time spent executing on the CPU.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{Waiting Time} (WT) = \text{Turnaround Time} - \text{Burst Time}
     \]
     or
     \[
     \text{Waiting Time} (WT) = \text{Start Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
     \]

### Calculation Example:

Let's assume we have 3 processes with the following information:

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| P1      | 0                 | 5               |
| P2      | 1                 | 3               |
| P3      | 2                 | 8               |

Now, let’s calculate the **Completion Time**, **Waiting Time**, and **Turnaround Time** for each process using **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)** scheduling.

1. **First, Calculate Completion Time (CT):**
   - **P1** arrives at time 0 and executes for 5 units of time.
     \[
     CT_P1 = 0 + 5 = 5
     \]
   - **P2** arrives at time 1, but since **P1** is still executing, **P2** starts at **time 5**.
     \[
     CT_P2 = 5 + 3 = 8
     \]
   - **P3** arrives at time 2, but since both **P1** and **P2** are executing before it, it starts at **time 8**.
     \[
     CT_P3 = 8 + 8 = 16
     \]

2. **Next, Calculate Turnaround Time (TAT):**
   - **P1**: 
     \[
     TAT_P1 = CT_P1 - AT_P1 = 5 - 0 = 5
     \]
   - **P2**:
     \[
     TAT_P2 = CT_P2 - AT_P2 = 8 - 1 = 7
     \]
   - **P3**:
     \[
     TAT_P3 = CT_P3 - AT_P3 = 16 - 2 = 14
     \]

3. **Finally, Calculate Waiting Time (WT):**
   - **P1**:
     \[
     WT_P1 = TAT_P1 - BT_P1 = 5 - 5 = 0
     \]
   - **P2**:
     \[
     WT_P2 = TAT_P2 - BT_P2 = 7 - 3 = 4
     \]
   - **P3**:
     \[
     WT_P3 = TAT_P3 - BT_P3 = 14 - 8 = 6
     \]

### Results for Each Process:

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) | Completion Time (CT) | Turnaround Time (TAT) | Waiting Time (WT) |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| P1      | 0                 | 5               | 5                    | 5                     | 0                 |
| P2      | 1                 | 3               | 8                    | 7                     | 4                 |
| P3      | 2                 | 8               | 16                   | 14                    | 6                 |

### **Average Waiting Time**:
To calculate the **average waiting time**, we sum up the waiting times of all processes and divide by the total number of processes.

\[
\text{Average Waiting Time} = \frac{0 + 4 + 6}{3} = 3.33
\]

### **Average Turnaround Time**:
To calculate the **average turnaround time**, we sum up the turnaround times of all processes and divide by the total number of processes.

\[
\text{Average Turnaround Time} = \frac{5 + 7 + 14}{3} = 8.67
\]

1. **Burst Time (BT)**: The time required for a process to complete its execution.
2. **Arrival Time (AT)**: The time at which a process arrives in the ready queue.
3. **Completion Time (CT)**: The time at which a process finishes execution.
4. **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: The total time spent by the process from its arrival to its completion.
5. **Waiting Time (WT)**: The time spent by a process waiting in the ready queue, excluding its execution time. 

These calculations help in determining the efficiency of different scheduling algorithms and their impact on process performance, including waiting time and turnaround time.
